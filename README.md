# Hyperlynk-Social
The fun, free and open social network fighting for a more decentralized and accessable internet.

Hi there, you might be here because you are interested in HyperLynk. HyperLynk is one of the first open-source social networks made from scratch.
As human beings, we think that privacy is very important in our day-to-day lives – online and in the real world. You might not be aware that Facebook, Twitter and nearly all the other major social media apps sell your data/privacy to advertisers so that they get money and you get targeted ads; they call this ‘innovation’ but we call it ‘data misuse. Each and every human being values their personal space, also known as ‘privacy’. We all need to respect this. That is exactly why we have created a social networking site called Hyperlynk. We respect your privacy. Along with this, we also want a more decentralized internet model, in which Hyperlynk Social will be our first attempt at implementing this.
